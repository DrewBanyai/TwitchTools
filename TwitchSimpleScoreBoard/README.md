# TwitchScoreBoard
A dead-simple chat-enabled score-board screen for Twitch streams

GETTING STARTED:
- Open Settings.js and enter your channel name, the name of your bot, and the oauth for your bot (oauth can be found at https://twitchapps.com/tmi/)
- Open the index.htm file in a browser source in OBS (or your given streaming software)
- In the given twitch channel's chat, type the following commands:
	- "!upscore USER"			~ Where USER is the twitch username, command will add 1 to their score
	- "!downscore USER"			~ Where USER is the twitch username, command will subtract 1 from their score
	- "!setscore USER COUNT"	~ Where USER is the twitch username and COUNT is a whole number, command will set score to that count
- Enjoy. Please let me know if you experience any issues with the bot template or need any help.
