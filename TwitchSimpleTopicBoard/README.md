# TwitchTopics
A dead-simple skeleton project to respond to twitch chat commands to show topics to talk about

GETTING STARTED:
- Open Settings.js and enter your channel name, the name of your bot, and the oauth for your bot (oauth can be found at https://twitchapps.com/tmi/)
- Open the index.htm (or Release/TwitchTopics.htm) file in a browser or in OBS
- In the given twitch channel's chat, type !topic X (where x is the topic index in the list in settings) or any invalid number (or none at all) to make the topics disappear
    - The intention is that if you had certain news topics to talk about, you can make them appear with keywords instead of typing them out manually while live
- Enjoy. Please let me know if you experience any issues with the bot template or need any help.
